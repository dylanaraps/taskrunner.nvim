INTRODUCTION					*taskrunner-introduction*

*taskrunner.nvim* is a simple plugin for Neovim that adds a :Task cmd that
runs gulp/grunt in a terminal split.

The plugin by default will look for your gulp/gruntfile in your current
working directory. If no taskrunner file is found it'll keep looking up a
directory.

The plugin only works with Neovim because it makes use of neovim's built in
terminal splits to create the taskrunner split. If installed in regular
vim the plugin won't do anything. So it's fine to install in a .vimrc used
in both vim/nvim.

USAGE						    *taskrunner-usage*

Create a split and run Gulp/Grunt.

>
    :Task

    " Command Example
    " The command on it's own will look in the open file's current working
    " directory.
    " If left blank the command will use the 'default' task.
    :Task taskname

    " More Command Examples:
    " You can also use all of gulp/grunt's cmdline flags!
    :Task --gulpfile ~/projects/gulpfile.coffee coffeescript

Command to use to launch taskrunner.

    " Default
    let g:taskrunner#cmd = "default"

    " Custom launch command for gulp
    let g:taskrunner#cmd = "gulp --no-color"

When left default the plugin will launch the task runners with their default
command:

- Gulp: 'gulp'
- Grunt: 'grunt'


Files to look for.

>
    " Default
    let g:taskrunner#filelist = ['gulpfile.js', 'gulpfile.coffee', 'gruntfile.js', 'gruntfile.coffee']

    " Only look for gulpfiles
    let g:taskrunner#filelist = ['gulpfile.js', 'gulpfile.coffee']

    " Only look for gruntfiles
    let g:taskrunner#filelist = ['gruntfile.js', 'gruntfile.coffee']
<


Size of the split.

>
    " Opens a horizontal split that is 10 high
    let g:taskrunner#split = "10new"

    " Opens a vertical split that is 30 wide
    let g:taskrunner#split = "30vnew"
<


Split Direction.

>
    " Sets split to open to the bottom and right
    let g:taskrunner#split_direction = "splitbelow splitright"

    " left/top
    let g:taskrunner#split_direction = "nosplitbelow nosplitright"

    " top
    let g:taskrunner#split_direction = "nosplitbelow"

    " top/right
    let g:taskrunner#split_direction = "nosplitbelow splitright"
